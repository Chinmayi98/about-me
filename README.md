## About
This repo will be used to share information about the tools and languages that are required to publish a repo with Github pages and also to share my class information.

## Recommended Tools
To pulish a repo with Github pages, all we need is a web browser. Some of the recommended tools are linked below. I personally use Google chrome as I find it very simple and fast. Github platform uses a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling, called ```Markdown```.
